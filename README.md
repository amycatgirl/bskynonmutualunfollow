# bskynonmutualunfollow

Unfollow people that do not follow you back

## Why?

i found [this thread (external link)](https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySocial/comments/1fdr4b8/tool_to_automaticaly_unfollow_everyone_who_doesnt/) on reddit where someone was asking for
a tool that automatically unfollows non-mutuals

and i thought to myself, hey, this should be easy to do

so um, yeah, it's now a thing

## Requirements

- NodeJS (I used the lts version, but any version that supports ESM should work)
- NPM (Comes with NodeJS)
- A computer with some sort of terminal or command prompt (I am too lazy to make it a site, sorry)

## Running

- Open a terminal and navigate to the repo
- Install dependencies using `npm i`
